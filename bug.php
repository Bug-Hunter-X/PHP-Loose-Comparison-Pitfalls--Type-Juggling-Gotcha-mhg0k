In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with type juggling and loose comparisons. Consider this scenario:

```php
$value = "0";
if ($value == 0) {
  echo "Value is zero";
}
```

This code will execute the `echo` statement.  The loose comparison (`==`) does not strictly check the type, leading to unexpected results.  While `"0"` is a string and `0` is an integer, PHP's type juggling converts the string to an integer for comparison, resulting in equality.  This is often unintentional, potentially causing logic errors.
