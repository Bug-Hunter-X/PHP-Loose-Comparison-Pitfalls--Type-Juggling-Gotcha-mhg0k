The solution lies in employing strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`).  Strict comparison checks for both value and type equality. 

```php
$value = "0";
if ($value === 0) {
  echo "Value is zero (strictly)";
} else {
  echo "Value is not zero (strictly)";
}
```

This revised code will output "Value is not zero (strictly)", accurately reflecting the type difference.  Always prefer strict comparison in PHP to avoid unexpected behavior caused by type juggling.
